# sisyphus

"... one must imagine sisyphus happy" - Albert Camus

Sisyphus was the O.G Scheduler, he doggedly rolled a rock up the mountain (only to have it roll back down) 
and he repeated that, everyday. 
He wasn't with limitations, he could do only one task.
That was until he discovered clojure, drunk on the power of clojure, **sisyphus can schedule
multiple tasks and will do them happily for you**, since anything is more fun than rolling a rock up the mountain,
that's how one ~~must imagine~~ knows sisyphus is happy.
